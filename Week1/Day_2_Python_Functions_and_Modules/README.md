## 📘 Description

Where: Real Python’s [Defining Your Own Python Function](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/) and freeCodeCamp Python curriculum.

How: Practice writing clean, reusable functions. Group related logic into modules. Add basic test scripts using `assert` statements to validate behavior.

<a id="elaboration"></a>
## ⚙️ Elaboration

- Start by reviewing function syntax, parameters, return values, and docstrings.
- Refactor previous scripts (e.g., calculator, word counter) into modular functions.
- Create a custom module (`utils.py`) and import it into main scripts.
- Write simple test scripts to validate function correctness using `assert`.

## 🔎 Subtopics to focus on

- Function definition and return values
- Positional vs keyword arguments
- Default parameters and `*args` / `**kwargs`
- Docstrings and function annotations
- Module creation and importing
- Basic testing with `assert` and `__name__ == "__main__"`

<a id="key-deliverables-checklist"></a>
## ✅ Key deliverables (checklist)

- [ ] `utils.py` module with at least 3 reusable functions
- [ ] Refactored script using functions from `utils.py`
- [ ] Test script with `assert`-based checks
- [ ] Function with docstring and type hints
- [ ] Script demonstrating `if __name__ == "__main__"` usage
