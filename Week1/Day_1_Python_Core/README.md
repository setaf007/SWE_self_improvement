## 📘 Description

Where: follow the Python official tutorial (docs.python.org), freeCodeCamp Python section, and selected Real Python articles.

How: Read the short tutorial sections on data types and control flow, then immediately apply by writing small scripts and 10 short exercises.

## ⚙️ Elaboration

- Spend the first half of the session reviewing basics: variables, data types, control flow, and common collection operations.
- Spend the second half implementing small scripts to reinforce syntax, tooling, and readability (PEP 8).

## 🔎 Subtopics to focus on

- Data types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- Loops & conditionals
- String formatting & slicing (f-strings)
- List/dict comprehensions
- File I/O and CSV reading
- Exception handling basics

## ✅ Key deliverables (checklist)

- [ ] calculator (basic arithmetic + input validation)
- [ ] csv parser (read CSV, summarize rows/columns)
- [ ] word counter (file-based word frequency)
- [ ] file renamer (batch rename files by pattern)
- [ ] temperature converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
