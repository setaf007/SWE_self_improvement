> 👋 Hi, I'm Taskin — a software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems and exploring all things tech.

---

Welcome to my personal learning repository. I'm a software engineer actively expanding my skills in software and data engineering. This repo documents my growth through hands-on projects, curated resources, and technical notes.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A journal of my learning progress
- A reference hub for concepts, tools, and patterns
- A portfolio of practical experiments
- A reflection space for challenges and breakthroughs

## 📂 Structure

The folders will be divided into weeks, and days (each day will have a readme.md that will explain what I have worked on and any further notes and observations from me.)


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
- **Infrastructure**: 
- **Databases**: 
- **Cloud & DevOps**: 

## 📌 Goals

- Build scalable, maintainable systems
- Master orchestration and automation
- Understand the "why" behind engineering patterns
- Document learnings for future reference and sharing

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

I favor:
- Example-driven exploration
- Root-cause analysis over quick fixes
- Modular, reproducible setups
- Open-source best practices

## 🙌 Contributions & Feedback

This is a personal journey, but I welcome:
- Suggestions for topics or tools
- Feedback on structure or clarity
- Collaboration on mini-projects

Feel free to open an issue or reach out!
